## Ohio University Software Development Club

We're (OUSDC), a club focused on providing a means for software developers to work on projects in a friendly, team-oriented environment.

To contribute to our projects, come join the club! We meet every monday at 4:15 in the Botanical Research Center. Once you join we can give you access to the GitHub Organization where you can join teams and gain access to our repositories.

All of our info can currently be found on this page, however in the future our info can be found at our [GitHub Pages site](ohio-software-development.github.io)

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
